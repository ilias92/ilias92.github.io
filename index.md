## Welcome to Ilias' GitHub Pages
 
 Hi, I am a graduate student in the [De Carvalho Lab](http://www.decarvalholab.org/) at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada.

### Research Interests

I am interesting in studying the role of Cancer Initiating Cell in the context of colorectal cancer. More specifically, I am interested in studying mechanisms involved in regulating cancer "stemness". Some key topics of interest include :

1. Epigenetic therapy  
* The use of DNA Demethylating Agents to target Cancer Initiating Cell.

2. Innate Immunity
* The role of activating a innate immune response in  Cancer Initiating Cell.
* The use of pharmacological inhibitors of epigenetic machinery to activate a viral response in cancer cells.
